# Gender_Detection
Gender detection typically refers to the process of determining the gender of a person based on their appearance or characteristics. In the context of machine learning, gender detection usually involves analyzing images or videos to classify individuals as male or female.

# Objective 
 develop accurate and reliable algorithms that can automatically determine the gender of individuals from images or videos

 # About the Project
 In this Python Project, I had used Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender of a person from a single image of a face. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’ (8 nodes in the final softmax layer). It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, I made this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.

 # Dataset
 For this python project, I had used the dataset; the dataset is available in the public domain and you can find it [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/gender-recognition-dataset/data)
. This dataset serves as a benchmark for face photos and is inclusive of various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance. The images have been collected from RASHIK RAHMAN and distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license. It has a total of 13,500 photos and is about 230MB in size. The models I used had been trained on this dataset.
